# PyBer_Analysis
PyBer Rideshare app analysis 

# Purpose of Analysis
The pupose of the analysis was to ascertain and detail the most profitibale city types for the company. This data can be used to drvie advertising, promotions to recruit more drivers and assist in deciding if services should be offered to certain regions/cities.

# Analysis
## Urban Analysis
Urban areas are the most pofitible for the company. Not only are there more rides but many more drivers than other regions. (See fig 2 https://github.com/NitewingGW/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig2.png) The Urban region may be becoming overly saturated as the average fair per driver in Urban cities is only $16.57. The company may want to increase avdvertising in urban areas to create more business but also consider limiting the number of drivers permitted to work in a given area. If drivers are not able to make a decent profit they may stop driving or switch to other companies. Which could effect availalibity for customers.

## Rural Analysis
Rural areas are the area most underserved. This is likely do to the area itself. Many people in rural have to have cars to travel thus have less need for a  tiding service. We may want to consider devoting more marketing funds to focus on the rural cities, but this should be done in a phased approached. As to not spend to much marketing funds on an area that may not produce much new growth. (see PyBer_fare_summary https://github.com/NitewingGW/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png) 

## Suburbs Analysis
Surburan cities appear to the area most susceptible for new growth. The service appears to be used regularly though no where near as prevelent as the city. Rides are of roughly 1/3 that of the urban cities and profit is less 1/2 that of the urban cities while drivers are less than half of the amount in the urban cities. 

### Suburban Potential
#### Riders
The data points to there possibly being a  significant room for growth if the company focuses on promoting the business to new riders. Maybe even offering deals or specials for holidays and to and from their nearest Urban city.

See Fig 6 https://github.com/NitewingGW/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig6.png
#### Drivers
The profit margin is high in the suburbs for the drivers due to the lower amount of drivers. With an increase in riders it would result in more profit for the drivers thus increasing the motivation and desire for more people to become drivers. Hence increasing company profibility overall.

# Recommendations
* Increasing marketing in the suburbs focusing on riders (possibly through discounts)
* increase avdvertising in urban areas to create more business but also consider limiting the number of drivers permitted to work in a given area. (Market is becoming saurated)
* Consider doing a phased approach to increase riders in rural areas. If this approach is not successful do a cost vs profit analysis for the rural cities. If profit minus advertising cost don't show considerable profit consider phasing out the business in the rural cities.
